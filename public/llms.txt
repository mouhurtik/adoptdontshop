## Directory Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router (pages: `/browse`, `/pet/[slug]`, `/community/[slug]`, `/pet-essentials`, etc.)
- `components/` - Reusable UI widgets, grouped by feature (`home/`, `pet-details/`, `browse/`, `community/`, `ui/`)
- `views/` - High-level page sections and orchestrators
- `lib/supabase/` - Database client wrappers for SSR and Browser contexts
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (e.g. `useMessages`, `useFavorites`, `useCommunity`)
- `contexts/` - Providers (e.g. `AuthContext`)

## Design Principles
- **SEO First:** Server Components with dynamic `generateMetadata` for pet and community post pages. RSS feed at `/feed.xml`. BlogPosting structured data on community posts.
- **Mobile Responsive:** All views use standard Tailwind breakpoints prioritizing mobile usability.
- **Playful Theme:** The UI leverages vibrant, custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.ts` (e.g. `playful-coral`, `playful-teal`).
